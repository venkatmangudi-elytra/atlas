# Atlas: The Deterministic Execution Security Standard (DESS)

**Atlas: The Deterministic Execution Security Standard (DESS)** is a global, vendor-neutral security architecture standard for defending against AI-amplified, self-mutating, and polymorphic threats.

Atlas defines how systems should be designed, built, and operated so that **only deterministic, verifiable, and policy-compliant execution is allowed**, and everything else is treated as untrusted by default.

## Purpose

This repository is the canonical home of **Atlas: DESS**. It contains:

- The official specification in versioned form.
- Reference diagrams and example architectures.
- Governance, contribution, and versioning information.
- Roadmaps and implementation guidance that map Atlas to existing standards such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001, MITRE ATT&CK / D3FEND, and privacy regulations.

## Repository structure

- `spec/`  
  Canonical Atlas-DESS specification documents (Markdown), versioned as `vX.Y`.

- `diagrams/`  
  Architecture, data flow, and reference implementation diagrams used by the specification and whitepapers.

- `governance/`  
  Governance model, contribution guidelines, and versioning policy for Atlas-DESS.

Additional directories may be added over time for case studies, translations, and implementation guides.

## Status

- Current spec version: `v0.1-draft`  
- Stability: **Draft**. Contents may change significantly as the standard evolves.
