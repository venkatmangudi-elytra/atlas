## ATLAS: DESS v0.1 Completion Checklist

### Completed Sections (Full Draft)
- [x] 3.12 Identity Controls
- [x] 3.13 Data Controls
- [x] 3.14 Execution Surface Controls
- [x] 3.15 Network Boundary Controls
- [x] 3.16 Observability & Evidence Controls
- [x] 3.17 Autonomous Code & Mutation Controls
- [x] 3.18 Cross-Domain Execution Controls
- [x] 3.19 Federation Controls
- [x] 3.20 Failure Controls
- [x] 3.21 Temporal Controls
- [x] 3.22 Supply Chain Controls

### Sections Completed but Need Expansion
- [x] 3.13.24–3.13.30 (Expand to full multi-line format)
- [x] 3.15 (Add more boundary surface controls)
- [x] 3.16 (Add cryptographic + forensic detail)
- [x] 3.17 (Add mutation + derivative lineage detail)
- [x] 3.19 (Expand identity brokering + multi-tenant logic)

### Sections Still Required to Close Section 3
- [ ] 3.23 Hardware & Trusted Execution Controls (ATLAS-HW)
- [ ] 3.24 Human Override Runtime Controls (ATLAS-HUMAN)
- [ ] 3.25 Physical Side-Channel Controls (ATLAS-PHYS)
- [ ] 3.26 Model Training/Data Pipeline Controls (ATLAS-TRAIN)
- [ ] 3.27 Cryptographic Key Lifecycle Controls (ATLAS-CRYPTO)
- [ ] 3.28 Deployment Boundary Controls (ATLAS-DEPLOY)
- [ ] 3.29 Secrets & Credential Controls (ATLAS-SECRET)
- [ ] 3.30 Evidence Retention & Classification (ATLAS-EVIDENCE)
- [ ] 3.31 Deterministic Incident Response Controls (ATLAS-IR)
- [ ] 3.32 Secure Decommissioning & Zeroization (ATLAS-ENDLIFE)
- [ ] 3.33 API & External Interface Boundary Controls (ATLAS-API)
- [ ] 3.34 Model Output & Behavior Safety Controls (ATLAS-SAFE)

### Quality Enforcement Going Forward
- [ ] Maintain full multi-line control format
- [ ] Include `---` before section headers
- [ ] Example-driven constraints
- [ ] No summaries in place of controls
- [ ] Expand all short sections before v1.0
